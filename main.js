//create functions for operations: add, subtract, multiply, divide


//create an 'operate' function that takes in 3 arguments: 2 integers and 1 operator, and this function will call the appropriate earlier declared function depending on the operator given.

//create functions that run the operations (listeners) and place the results into the display of the calculator. 
//Don't forget to save the output as a variable as it will be usable with any proceeding operations. ex 1+1-2, 1+1 needs to be solved and displayed as they hit + and then 2 and then that total needs to display
//Each time operate is called === update the display to the user.

//round long decimals to a point so they don't overflow the display

//disallow pressing = out of order

//clear button should wipe everything done so far

//if the user tries to divide by 0, display to them a snarky message



//extra credit: add a decimal button that allows users to create floating point numbers, but don't allow more than one
    //add a backspace button, so users can undo their last input 
//add keyboard support
