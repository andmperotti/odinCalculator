    <!--Create a display for the calculator output, don't forget to initially give it dummy content to make sure it displays-->
    <!--Need buttons for each individual number 0-9, for each operator +/*-, and =, and since i'm doing the extra credit will need a clear button, back button, decimal button even though I'll add their logic even later-->
    <!--You can also add a modulous which returns the remainder, and a positive/negative button which allows you to change the value you just typed in to negative/back to positive-->
